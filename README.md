# godot-pong
## Details
A classic pong game recreated in Godot game engine. This serves as a practice for me to get my hands wet on using godot and as a playground so that I could experiment with things.

## How to play
You control the left paddle using UP and DOWN arrow keys, my super intelligent AI is the right paddle. Your goal is to block the ball from reaching your goal, otherwise my AI gains point, vice versa. Whoever reaches 2 points win.
